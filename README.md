# Description
Theme to replicate the workbench and syntax highlighting from Sublime Text 3 with MavensMate when editing Apex code.  This is as close as possible with some subtle differences.

- Support added especially for Salesforce Apex code to mimic MavensMate Monokai syntax highlighting
- References the Salesforce grammar (apex.tmLanguage) in the Salesforce Extension Pack for VSCode

# Background
For many years, I used Sublime Text 3 with MavensMate and the Monokai color theme.  The MavensMate IDE is no longer supported and now Salesforce DX and VSCode are the way to go.  If anyone is like me and got used to that specific scenario of syntax highlighting for Apex code, then this is especially for you.

# VSCode Salesforce IDE Setup Guide
Moving from Sublime Text with MavensMate to VSCode and Salesforce DX is not the most intuitive process.  When your goal is to simply connect to a Salesforce sandbox, it may not be easy to find a quick guide to get set up.  Here's a link to the step-by-step guide I wrote for myself once I figured it out:
