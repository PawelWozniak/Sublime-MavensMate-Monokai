# Description
Theme to replicate the workbench and syntax highlighting from Sublime Text 3 with MavensMate when editing Apex code.  This is as close as possible with some subtle differences.  This theme references the Salesforce grammar (apex.tmLanguage) in the Salesforce Extension Pack for VSCode.

# Apex Code
In my opinion, this is the most supreme way to develop Apex code using a dark theme in VSCode.  Please enjoy!

# Background
For many years, I used Sublime Text 3 with MavensMate and the Monokai color theme.  The MavensMate IDE is no longer supported and now Salesforce DX and VSCode are the way to go.  If anyone is like me and got used to that specific scenario of syntax highlighting for Apex code, then this is especially for you.
